# Deploy this Blog to Vercel

You have two easy options.

## Option A — Drag & Drop (fastest)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new (log in or create a free account).
2. Drag the **`oic-error-hospital-site`** folder (or the ZIP) onto the page.
3. Vercel will detect a **Static Site** and deploy it automatically.
4. You’ll get a public URL like `https://your-project.vercel.app/` immediately.

## Option B — Git + Import

1. Create a new GitHub repo and push these files.
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new and **Import Git Repository**.
3. Framework Preset: **Other** (Static). Build: none. Output: root.
4. Deploy to receive your public URL.
